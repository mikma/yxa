Description: SIP software written in Erlang
 Yxa is SIP software written in Erlang  (Erlang is a programming language
 written by Ericsson).
 .
 Yxa is both a transaction stateful SIP stack, and a set of SIP server
 applications.
 .
 Main features
 .
    * RFC3261 compliant SIP-server, capable of everything a generic
      domain needs :
          o Registrar that keeps track of your users
          o Handles incoming SIP requests to your domain
          o Handles routing of requests from your users to remote domains
          o TCP, UDP and TLS (including SIPS) support
          o Automatically maps e-mail addresses of your users to their
            SIP addresses, if you have the e-mail addresses in LDAP
          o Handles multiple domains using a single server instance 
    * ENUM support for PSTN-bypass whenever possible
    * IPv6 support
    * Forking, both parallel and sequential
    * CPL (RFC3880) support for advanced user-control of events (currently
      incoming calls only)
    * Modular user database, currently with LDAP, Mnesia, MySQL and
      text-file backends
    * PSTN destination access control (per user or for anonymous users)
 .
 Included applications:
 .
  * incomingproxy:
    Handles registrations and proxies requests. Implements partial ENUM
    and LDAP searches. Handles most everything you need to set up SIP for your
    domain.
 .
  * outgoingproxy:
    Special proxy for clients behind NAT. 
 .
  * pstnproxy:
    Designed as an authentication frontend to an insecure PSTN gateway.
 .
  * appserver:
    Provides basic forking and CPL script interpretation.
 .
  * yxa_yaws:
    Embedded web server interface.
